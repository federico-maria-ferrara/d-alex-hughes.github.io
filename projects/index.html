  <span class="abstract hidden">
    <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a complex global
                  problem, not only because it is a human rights
                  issue, but also because it is associated with
                  chronic mental and physical illnesses as well as
                  acute health outcomes related to injuries for women
                  and their children. Attitudes, beliefs, and norms
                  regarding IPV are significantly associated with the
                  likelihood of both IPV experience and
                  perpetration. Our results show that differential
                  targeting of individuals and relationships in order
                  to reduce the acceptability and, subsequently, the
                  prevalence of IPV may be most effective. Because IPV
                  norms seem to be strongly held within households,
                  the household is probably the most logical unit to
                  target in order to implement change. This approach
                  would include the possible benefit of a generational
                  effect. Finally, in social contexts in which
                  perpetration of IPV is not socially acceptable, the
                  most effective strategy may be to implement change
                  not at the center but at the periphery of the
                  community.</p>

    <p>One of the best-known and most replicated laboratory
                  results in behavioral economics is that bargainers
                  frequently reject low offers, even when it harms
                  their material self-interest. This finding could
                  have important implications for international
                  negotiations on many problems facing humanity today,
                  because models of international bargaining assume
                  exactly the opposite: that policy makers are
                  rational and self-interested. However, it is unknown
                  whether elites who engage in diplomatic bargaining
                  will similarly reject low offers because past
                  research has been based almost exclusively on
                  convenience samples of undergraduates, members of
                  the general public, or small-scale societies rather
                  than highly experienced elites who design and
                  bargain over policy. Using a unique sample of 102
                  policy and business elites who have an average of 21
                  y of practical experience conducting international
                  diplomacy or policy strategy, we show that, compared
                  with undergraduates and the general public, elites
                  are actually more likely to reject low offers when
                  playing a standard “ultimatum game” that assesses
                  how players bargain over a fixed resource. Elites
                  with more experience tend to make even higher
                  demands, suggesting that this tendency only
                  increases as policy makers advance to leadership
                  positions. This result contradicts assumptions of
                  rational self-interested behavior that are standard
                  in models of international bargaining, and it
                  suggests that the adoption of global agreements on
                  international trade, climate change, and other
                  important problems will not depend solely on the
                  interests of individual countries, but also on
                  whether these accords are seen as equitable to all
                  member states.</p>

    <p>Experimental evidence in cognitive psychology and
                  behavioral economics is transforming the way
                  political science scholars think about how humans
                  make decisions in areas of high complexity,
                  uncertainty, and risk. Nearly all those studies
                  utilize convenience samples of university students,
                  but in the real world political elites actually make
                  most pivotal political decisions such as threatening
                  war or changing the course of economic
                  policy. Highly experienced elites are more likely to
                  exhibit the attributes of rational decision making;
                  and over the last fifteen years a wealth of studies
                  suggest that such elites are likely to be more
                  skilled in strategic bargaining than samples with
                  less germane experience. However, elites are also
                  more likely to suffer overconfidence, which degrades
                  decision making skills. We illustrate implications
                  for political science with a case study of crisis
                  bargaining between the US and North
                  Korea. Variations in the experience of US elite
                  decision-makers between 2002 and 2006 plausibly
                  explain the large shift in US crisis signaling
                  better than other rival hypotheses such as “Iraq
                  fatigue.” Beyond crisis bargaining other major
                  political science theories might benefit from
                  attention to the attributes of individual
                  decision makers.</p>
